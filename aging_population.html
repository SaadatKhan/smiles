            Talk Saves Lives is AFSP’s standardized, 45-60 minute education
            program that provides participants with a clear understanding of
            this leading cause of death, including the most up-to-date research
            on suicide prevention, and what they can do in their communities to
            save lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants will learn common risk factors and warning signs
            associated with suicide, and how to keep themselves and others safe.
            The standard Talk Saves Lives presentation is also available in
            Spanish.

            In 2014, Mental Health America (MHA) launched their online mental
            health screening: a collection of online, free, confidential,
            anonymous, and scientifically validated screening tools to help
            individuals understand and learn more about their mental health.

            The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that leads public health efforts to advance the behavioral health of the nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Congress established the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992 to make substance use and mental disorder information, services, and research more accessible.
